# Worksheet 8: Object-Oriented Design

This week we are looking at object-oriented design, and in particular user stories and class
design. Both of these are a while of getting the user into our perspective. We will start with
user stories, before moving onto class design. We recommend using Draw IO
(https://app.diagrams.net/) to create the class diagrams.

## User Stories

```
As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]
```
1. Design a set of user stories for someone using a streaming application. You will want
    to add television and movies, and the genre of the content and the ability to rate it.
2. Design user stories for a customer at an online burger restaurant. The customer
    should be able to choose the type of burger that they want and the address that
    they live at. You should also add drivers who will need to travel to the customers.
3. Design user stories for a ride sharing app. You will want to have both passengers and
    drivers. Passengers would like to have a safe trip, using an existing method to pay
    and chose their driver. Drivers would like to attract, and safety choose their
    passengers.

## Class Diagrams

4. Image that you have a Rectangle and a RectangleUser class. A RectangleUser would
    like to do the following:
    - As a RectangleUser I would like to store the height and width within a
       Rectangle class
    - As a RectangleUser I would like to get the Rectangle’s perimeter so that I can
       view it
    - As a RectangleUser I would like to get the Rectangle’s area so that I can view
       it
    Write a class diagram for the Rectangle and the RectangleUser. Be sure to include all
    of the properties, fields, methods and class relationships.


5. Image that you are implementing an online store. You have the following user stories
    - As a Customer I would like to register with the company so that I do not have
       to enter my details each time I order
    - As a Customer I would like to edit my details so that I they can be easy
       changed
    - As a Customer I would like to delete my details so that I can be forgotten
    - As a Customer I would like to order a specific product from the store
    - As a Customer I would like to make a change to my order in case my opinion
       changes
    - As a Customer I would like to make sure that there is enough stock in order
       so that I can get the product
Write a class diagram for all the classes. Be sure to include all of the properties,
fields, methods and class relationships

## Putting it all Together

6. Design user stories and class diagrams for a university. First, you should come up
    with suitable stories for a student, a tutor and a lecturer. Second, put together a
    class diagram of the university. There should be an emphasis on on-line delivery.

## Homework

7. Design user stories and class diagram for a bank customer. Think about how bank
    customers would like to interact with their bank. Think about what services the
    banks would offer the customers.
